An app to help you go from swimming zero to 1650 (MDCL) meters in six weeks.

## Technology
The application will be used to demonstrate a simple cross-device development project using the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/). Suggestions and Pull Requests are welcome.

## Primary Goals

When complete the application should meet the following goals and objectives:
 * Allow a swimmer to track progress over a six-week period.
 * Display modes to show program overview, as well as details for an individual day.
 * Store progress for one user.
 * Allow swimmer to repeat individual days' programs.
 * Run on Android and iPhone.

## Secondary Goals
 * Provide automatic converstion between meters, yards, feet, laps, and lengths, to allow for a different pool lengths.
 * Post progress updates to Facebook and Twitter.
 * Use local notification to remind the user to swim.
 * Be available in the respective application stores as a free app.
 
## Tertiary Goals
 * Provide modifications of the program to 4 and 8 weeks.
 * Provide a true "novice" mode for zero to 700 meters.
 * Allow use of Social media accounts (Facebook, Twitter) to logon and store progress per user.
 * Use an ad-framework to demonstrate integrating ads into Ionic apps.
 * Provide a paid, ad-free, alternative (or use in-app purchase to remove ads).
